# 03_Predict_Online-Learning-Completion_202401100300053
This project aims to predict whether a student will complete an online course using machine learning techniques. We analyze data from an online learning platform and preprocess it by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical ones. A Random Forest Classifier is used for prediction due to its accuracy and robustness. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix. Visualizations like count plots and feature importance graphs help interpret the results. This can assist online platforms in improving student retention and course completion rates.
